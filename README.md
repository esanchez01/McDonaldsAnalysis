# McDonalds Sales Analysis

This project was developed as an assignment for DSC106: Introduction to Data Visualization. 

The purpose was primarily to practice creating visualizations through HTML, CSS, and Javascript. However, given that this is a data science course, we also needed to explore some mock data.

## Prompt
The CEO of McDonalds eagerly wants to know the impact that Burger King's Impossible Burger has had on the company's sales. As part of the data science team at McDonalds, our (my) job is to explore the data to determine the impact and additionally learn more about consumer trends. The final presentation is in the form of a report and the CEO is eager to take action based on its findings.
